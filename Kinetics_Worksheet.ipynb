    "* Fit the absorbance decay curve for one of the experiments in Set A with three alternative models, each corresponding to a different kinetic order with respect to methylene blue. From the three plots verifies that the model that best describes the kinetics is the first order one. In fitting the three models, you will realize that the very first part of your experiment does not fit well with any of the models. This is because the transient regimes that occurs at the beginning of the experiment as you mix your reactants has a complicated behavior that does involve mass transport in the liquid and does not follow any of the steady-state kinetic models that you have studied. As part of this task, adjust the transient time until at least one of the fits appears reasonable. Report this transient time with your comments and keep it in mind for the later tasks."
