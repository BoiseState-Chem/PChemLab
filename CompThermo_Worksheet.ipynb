    "When starting a computational experiment one needs to perform a preliminary assessment of the accuracy and costs of different levels of theory for the specific tasks at hand. For this preliminary calibration experiment, the goal is to figure out a model chemistry (i.e. a combination of method and basis set) that gives reasonable stability trends for alkenes and that requires a reasonable computational time. This task is vague on purpose, as different researchers with different goals and resources will have different definitions of what is reasonable. It is important in your selection process that you provide some justification on why something is (or is not) reasonable to you. \n",

For this lab, we will perform the first three sets of experiments on smaller alkenes with formula C4H8. "

Alternative more experimentally acccessible definitions of formation energies involve the atoms in their stable elemental forms as reference precursors. However, for the problem at hand either the isolated atoms or the elemental precursors will have the same identical energies for all isomers. If we neglect zero-point motion contributions (vibrations) and entropic effects, comparing formation energies is equivalent to comparing the total electronic energies of the different isomers in their equilibrium geometries.\n",
