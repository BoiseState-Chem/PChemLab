# PChemLab @ Boise State

## Overview
PChemLab is a collection of Colab/Jupyter notebooks designed for the analysis and modeling of the experiments in the physical chemistry laboratory course (CHEM 324 at Boise State). The project includes various worksheets and modeling data for experiments such as bomb calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), kinetics, particle in a box, quantum yield, and vibrational-rotational spectroscopy.
