However, it is important to stress that contrary to HF and DFT, MP2 is not a variational method.

    "While total energies are very important, so far we have only relied on atomic coordinates that have been built for us by CirPy and very likely do not represent the correct equilibrium geometries of the molecules we are studying. Given an initial structure we can use quantum chemistry to relax the positions of the atoms towards the equilibrium geometries, e.g. by following the direction of the forces on the atoms, going downhill in the potential energy surface. This type of calculation is known as 'geometry optimization', 'geoopt', or 'relax' calculation. \n",

Since geometry optimization calculations involve running multiple single-point energy steps, we usually adopt cheaper methods and smaller basis sets for that step. We can then use the optimized geometry to run a more accurate single-point energy calculation. In this section we will review the whole process for a more challenging system, with a larger number or atoms and electrons. "
