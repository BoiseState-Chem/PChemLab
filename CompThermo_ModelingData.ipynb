    "Most chemistry applications of quantum mechanics (a.k.a. quantum chemistry) relies on a powerful commercial software called Gaussian. This code was first developed by a forefather of quantum chemistry and Nobel prize winner John Pople. However, Gaussian is a Fortran 77 code that requires an expensive license to run. For our applications we can achieve the same results using Python-based codes, at the expense of some computing time. In the following we will be using [PySCF](https://pyscf.org/index.html) for our quantum chemistry calculations, so we will need to install it on our Colab instance."
