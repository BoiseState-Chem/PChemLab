    "The key component of the Huckel model is the fact that the molecular orbitals are univoquely determined by the topology of the conjugated network. The model assumes that we only consider the $p_z$ orbitals of each conjugated atom and we build molecular orbitals from them. As a further approximation, only atomic orbitals that are in connected atoms are allowed to 'interact'. Eventually, we assume that all atoms and bonds are equivalent, so that the relative components of the molecular Hamiltonian are identical. The Hamiltonian of the system can thus be represented as a matrix, where diagonal cells $H_{ii}$ have identical values, while off-diagonal elements $H_{ij}$ are different from zero only if there is a bond between atom $i$ and atom $j$. For carbon based molecules, the model only relies on two parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. However, the difference in energy between the electronic states only depends on the latter parameter, which is usually estimated to be $\\beta\\approx-70.4\\; kcal/mol$."
